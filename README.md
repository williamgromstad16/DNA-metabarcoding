# Methodolical information

This study was performed on 12 sites positioned throughout southeastern
Norway spanning 200 km in latitude and 160 km in longitude. Within each
site we established two plots, with an average distance of 1270 m
(range: 540-3140 m), where one was in a mature previously clear-cut
stand and the other in a near-natural stand that had not been subjected
to clear-cutting, but where selective cuttings (of various intensity)
likely have occurred. 20 dead wood logs, all at least over 5 cm in
diameter, were randomly selected along transects of in the 24 plots.
Sawdust was collected from each log and six soil samples were pooled
from each plot.

Samples were homogenized and DNA extracted using a modified CTAB
protocol, then stored in -80°C. The COI gene using the primer pair
BF3/BR2 (421 bp) from the DNA extracts. Illumina Miseq sequencing at
StarSeq was used, and the sequences underwent bioinformatic sequencing
as in <https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2021.2622>. Sequences were matched
against the NCBI and BOLD databases.

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

``` r
summary(cars)
#>      speed           dist       
#>  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
#>  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
#>  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
#>  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
#>  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
#>  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub.
